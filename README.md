# autism-prediction

This project focuses on predicting autism in adults using a dataset of survey responses and demographic features. The data underwent cleaning, encoding, and balancing to address missing values and class imbalance. Three machine learning models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were trained and optimized using randomized search with cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of around 92%, outperforming the other models. The results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble methods for this task, and the best model is positioned for use in screening tools to support early autism detection.
